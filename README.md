# Private Stickers Telegram Bot

Telegram bot to create private stickerpacks using InlineQuery feature.

## Description

<b>Stickerpacks</b> feature is a crucial functionality of Telegram, the world-wide famous messenger. But stickerpacks themselves are public, meaning any user can use stickerpack via its unique symbolic ID. My bot offers the way to fix this privacy issue by allowing users to create, edit and delete private stickerpacks and to manage access control for them via invite codes.

This bot uses [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

## Capabilites

Basic commands are:

- `/createpack` - create new stickerpack
- `/addpack` - add already existing stickerpack via invite code
- `/addsticker` - add sticker to the stickerpack you own
